    Explore API

    The Opendatasoft Explore API v2 is organized around REST. It provides access to all the data available through the platform in a coherent, hierarchical way.  - Only the HTTP `GET` method is supported. - All API endpoints return JSON. - Endpoints are organized in a hierarchical way describing the relative relationship between objects. - All responses contain a list of links allowing easy and relevant navigation through the API endpoints. - All endpoints use the [Opendatasoft Query Language (ODSQL)](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/#section/Opendatasoft-Query-Language-(ODSQL)). This means that, most of the time, parameters work the same way for all endpoints. - While the `records` endpoint is subject to a [limited number of returned records](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/#tag/Dataset/operation/getRecords), the `exports` endpoint has no limitations.
